  # Command prefix for executing the command
  # Can be used to change the shell, or disable shell interpretation
  # of `command` altogether.

  # Clone mode: "partial", "shallow", or "full" (default: partial)
  # - partial: Fast, uses partial clone (--filter=blob:none) - all commits, blobs on-demand
  # - shallow: Most compact, uses shallow clone (--depth=1) - single commit only
  # - full: Complete clone with all history and objects

# Merge queue configuration (optional)
# mq:
#   # Default base branch for merge queue
#   base-branch: main
#
#   # Merge style: "rebase" or "merge" (default: rebase)
#   # - rebase: Rebase candidate commits on top of base branch (no merge commit)
#   # - merge: Create a merge commit
#   merge-style: rebase
#
#   # MQ hooks - run at different stages of the merge queue process
#   # Each hook has: command (required), command-prefix (optional, default: ["bash", "-c"])
#   # Hooks can also be defined in local.yaml (not checked into source control)
#   # Local hooks override hooks defined here.

#   # Runs before daemonization with inherited stdio (allows interactive input)

#   # Runs after daemonization with captured output (non-interactive)
#   # post-start:
#   #   command: 'echo "Post-start (captured)"'
#
#   # Runs before worktrees are created for each candidate
#   # pre-clone:
#   #   command: 'echo "Running pre-clone"'
#
#   # Runs after worktrees are created, before the job command
#   # post-clone:
#   #   command: 'echo "Running post-clone"'
#
#   # Runs after check passes, before merging
#   # pre-merge:
