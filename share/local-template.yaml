# SelfCI Local Configuration
#
# This file contains local overrides that are NOT checked into source control.
# Add .config/selfci/local.yaml to your .gitignore file.

# Values here override the corresponding values in ci.yaml.

# MQ hooks configuration (optional)
# These hooks run at different stages of the merge queue process.
# mq:
#   # Runs BEFORE daemonization with inherited stdio (allows interactive input)
#   # Use for: password prompts, keychain unlock, interactive authentication
#   # Output is displayed directly to the terminal, stdin is available
#   pre-start:
#     command: 'echo "Pre-start hook (interactive)"'
#     # command-prefix: ["bash", "-c"]
#
#   # Runs AFTER daemonization with captured output (non-interactive)
#   # Use for: notifications, non-interactive setup, logging
#   # Output is captured and logged, no stdin available
#   post-start:
#     command: 'echo "Post-start hook (captured)"'
#
#   # Runs before worktrees are created for each candidate
#   # Use for: pre-flight checks, rate limiting, external validations
#   pre-clone:
#     command: 'echo "Running pre-clone"'
#
#   # Runs after worktrees are created, before the job command
#   # Has access to SELFCI_BASE_DIR and SELFCI_CANDIDATE_DIR
#   # Use for: code analysis, additional validation on the actual code
#   post-clone:
#     command: 'echo "Running post-clone"'
#
#   # Runs after check passes, before merging
#   # Use for: final validations, approvals, etc.
#   # If this hook fails, the merge is skipped.
#   pre-merge:
#     command: 'echo "Running pre-merge"'
#
#   # Runs after a successful merge
#   # Use for: notifications, deployments, etc.
#   post-merge:
